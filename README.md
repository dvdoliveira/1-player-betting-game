## Game Rules:

* The players start off with $100 and are asked to place a bet between $5 and $10
* Then they have to enter a number between 1 and 10 in order to guess the correct number
* The computer will select a random number for comparison with the players choices
* If they get the number exactly, they double their money
* If they are only off by 1, they get to keep their bet
* Otherwise they lose their bet
* The game ends if the player loses all their money
